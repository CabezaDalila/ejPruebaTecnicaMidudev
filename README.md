## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of two APIs to display dynamic content. The objective is to combine random cat facts with relevant GIFs in a visually appealing layout.

### APIs Used

1. **[Cat Random Facts](https://catfact.ninja/fact)**: Provides random facts about cats.
2. **[Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)**: Retrieves GIFs based on search terms.

### Functionality

1. Fetch a random cat fact from the Cat Random Facts API.
2. Extract the first three words of the fact.
3. Use these three words as a search query to retrieve a GIF from the Giphy API.
4. Display the result as follows:
   - **GIF** on the left.
   - **Cat fact text** on the right.
   - Both elements are centered vertically.
